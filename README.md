According to Figure, using the sequential GS method for reconstruction results cannot select the reconstruction plane, and tends to use the last plane as a constraint, so only the image displaying the last layer of plane can be reconstructed. The global GS method can reconstruct images of each plane, but the amplitude distribution of the reconstructed image is uneven, resulting in bright and dark spots on the display. The SFS-ORAP-PC-3D method has shown good reconstruction results, and the generation of phase holograms is faster and more flexible.
